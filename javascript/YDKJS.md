## this is notes of read "you donot js" books

To type multiple lines into the console at once, use `<shift> + <enter>` to move to the next new line

prefer to do this by typing `about:blank`

an easier way to get input is to use the prompt(..) function
```javascript
age = prompt( "Please tell me your age:" );
console.log( age );
```
#### most common operators in JavaScript
- Math: + (addition), - (subtraction), * (multiplication), and / (division)
- Compound Assignment: +=, -=, *=, and /= are compound operators that combine a math operation with assignment, as in a += 2 (same as a = a + 2).
- Increment/Decrement: ++ (increment), -- (decrement), as in a++ (similar to a = a + 1).
- Object Property Access: . as in console.log().Objects are values that hold other values at specific named locations called properties.obj.a means an object value called obj with a property of the name a. Properties can alternatively be accessed as obj["a"].
- Equality: == (loose-equals), === (strict-equals), != (loose not-equals), !== (strict not-equals), as in a == b.
- Comparison: < (less than), > (greater than), <= (less than or loose-equals), >= (greater than or loose-equals), as in a <= b.
- Logical: && (and), || (or), as in a || b that selects either a or b.These operators are used to express compound conditionals, like if either a or b is true.
